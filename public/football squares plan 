Make login form/page
once user logs in, user chooses which game to join
once certain game is selected, they can see the table of squares that are already bought or are available to purchase
once they click on a square they want, user is asked if they are sure they want the box they selected
if yes, they then are asked to pay for their square
once payment goes through, their username gets filled into the box they bought (sounds like a POST)


*** future feature ***
- user can outbid a square that was previously bought
